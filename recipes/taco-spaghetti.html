  <h1>Taco Spaghetti</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      One-pot taco spaghetti is a fast-as-can-be weeknight dinner that pairs all
      your favorite taco fixin's with spaghetti rather than taco shells. It's
      perfect for those nights when you just cannot stand the thought of a sink
      full of dirty dishes. Everything here comes together in one potâ€”from
      browning the beef to simmering the sauce, even boiling the spaghetti!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. 93% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 c. water</li>
      <li>1 (14.5-oz. can) diced tomatoes, preferably Rotel</li>
      <li>1 (1-oz.) packet or 2 tbsp. homemade taco seasoning</li>
      <li>8 oz. spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 oz. Velveeta cheese or American cheese, cut or torn into pieces</li>
      <li>1 c. (4 oz.) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>1/2 c. chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>Sour cream or Mexican crema, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium-high heat, cook ground beef, onion, and
        garlic, stirring occasionally, until beef is browned, 5 to 6 minutes.
        Add water, tomatoes, and taco seasoning, then cover and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break spaghetti in half lengthwise and add to sauce. Reduce heat to
        medium, cover, and simmer until pasta is tender, 12 to 14 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and stir in Velveeta, cheddar, and cilantro until
        cheese is melted. Serve topped with more cilantro and sour cream, if
        using.
      </li>
    </ol>
